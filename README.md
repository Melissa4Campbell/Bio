## Current Work

**Academic:** Preparing for Computer Engineering coursework at UTK (Spring 2026 transfer)  
**Professional:** Actively seeking summer 2026 internships and co-op opportunities  
**Learning:** Expanding C++ knowledge for systems programming and algorithm implementation  
**Project:** Building a comprehensive Python animal classification system from the ground up. Starting with foundational implementation of taxonomic tree structures using object-oriented programming to represent hierarchical biological classification (Kingdom through Species). Long-term goal is to develop a multi-modal identification system incorporating text-based characteristics, interactive questioning, machine learning classification algorithms, image recognition, and DNA/genetic data analysis. Project serves as practical application for learning Python fundamentals while building toward bioinformatics and computational biology skills.
